### Extraction of Hand-Written text from Image

> The Vision Of This Project is Described Below!
<ol>
  <li>Starting With PyTesseract Which is Fairly Simple & Easy to Use OCR Model</li>
  <li>Then Going to OPEN CV's EAST Alogorithm, Which is a Text Detector and makes use of bounding boxes to spot text</li>
  <li>Then Making A combination of Both PyTesseract & East Which Will be a better version of PyTesseract OCR</li>
  <li>Then We'll be using CRNN + CTC Models to Extract Handwritten text</li>
